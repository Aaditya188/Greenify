# Greenify
We have build a web app that determines the health of plant by analyzing the plant's leaf image

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or above with all [requirements](requirements.txt) dependencies installed. To install run:
```python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Motivation
Often plants wither because they are infected and the disease is not detected at an early stage. With this project we wish to deploy a web app capable to be used by any individual to determine whether their plants are healthy or are infected and they can treat their plants accordingly.
