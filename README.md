# Greenify
We have build a website that determines the health of plant by analyzing the plant's leaf image

## Motivation
Often plants wither because they get infected and are the disease is not detected at an early stage. With this project we wish to deploy a web app capable that any individual can easily use to determine whether their plants are healthy or are infected and they can treat thier plants accordingly.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or above with all [requirements](requirements.txt) dependencies installed. To install run:
```python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
